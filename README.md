## Overview

Welcome to the Maze Game! This is a simple terminal-based game written in C++ where the player navigates through multiple levels of mazes. The objective is to collect money (`m`) and reach the end of the maze marked by `E`. Each piece of money collected is worth 10 points, and the game keeps track of the total score across all levels.
